        <h3>Improving sales</h3>
        <p align = "justify">
         Tenneco Automotive, an automotive component, Fortune 500 company, operating in more than 30 countries, came to India in late 90’s through a joint venture and subsequently acquired 100% of the business. Being a new player in India, it had the uphill task of building a sales pipeline. The major part of revenues typically came from OEM’s directly. The existing players like Gabriel etc. were well entrenched into the OEM’s for decades. Our problem was to figure out how to displace them and win the business. We strategized that there were three ways we could do this and break the competition’s long-standing relationship with the OEM’s.
        </p>
        
        <p align = "justify">
          We arrived at this three-pronged strategy based on the current SWOT analysis of our competitors and ourselves, by studying the trends in the Indian market, and by understanding the strengths of Tenneco globally. These three strategies were:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>The SWOT indicated that existing players were weaker than us on technology . With the market opening up to international automotive players, we knew the market will demand the latest technologies in our product range ( shock absorbers, McPherson Struts, Exhaust systems ). We decided to bring the best and most appropriate technologies from across the global to India.</li>
          
          <li>The process with which the OEM’s and the existing players interacted and developed and engineered these products was archaic. With international competition entering in the country we knew that this would not suffice any longer. Hence, we created a strong Program Management Cell along with a highly capable engineering team . These two teams worked in tandem to program manage the entire process of , engineering design, design freeze, Costing , quoting, order finalization , prototype development , testing , final design freeze, manufacturing and JIT supply systems. This required a top- notch Program Management team and capability to be established. Our service was better, and the time taken for the entire product development cycle was reduced significantly .</li>
          
          <li>We knew that global players coming to India would in all probability, have an existing relationship with Tenneco in some part of the world. We leveraged those relationships extremely well to be able to develop our India OEM relationships.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p> The result was that we acquired close to 70% market share in Ride Control products (shock absorbers/struts) and were slowly gathering new platform businesses in the Emission Control product range as well starting from scratch.</p>
