        <h3>Business transformation for MTAR group</h3>
        <p align = "justify">
            MTAR was a 49-year-old company when I took up the reins as CEO. It served the Aerospace, Defense and other strategic sectors with their high precision engineering facilities. They could machine parts, fabricate, surface treat and assemble complex components and systems. While it had a good reputation with marquee customers it was not growing fast enough, the work practices were archaic, and they had not developed their engineering design capability. It had seen decent profits only in few years of its existence. After studying the company, I discovered that the company really needed a serious overhaul. In other words, a Business Transformation , but with speed. I decided to focus on a few important areas on priority.
            <ol>
                <li>Decision Making : Chairman was old yet taking day to day decisions, further complicated by personality issues between him and other Promoter Directors. I therefor created a Management Committee with four Directors and myself , who could meet or discuss regularly and take timely and well though decisions. This enabled me to fast track decisions on key initiatives targeting transformation</li>
                <li>Systems &amp; Processes: Created a detailed Annual Operating Plan , cascaded responsibilities, focused on Production and timely deliveries through appropriate Review Mechanisms. This had a major impact in increasing the revenues as well as customer satisfaction. The detailed , structured Production meetings led to better machine utilization and enhanced profitability.</li>
                <li>Redesigned the Ideal Org. Structure , started hiring higher capability talent at affordable costs. Role clarity, Span of control and head count and cost reduction led to an improved work culture. Things started moving. Urgency, Data based decision making and better team work was driven through training, constant team events.</li> 
                <li>ERP: The company had an old , ineffective system. We gave immense importance and mindshare to start the implementation of a new ERP by involving all functional leaders and their key reports. This was a like a business process re-engineering exercise, and it opened up the minds of people to more structured and data driven method of working.</li>
                <li>Sales: The company did not generate sales, it waited for tenders or customers to give their orders. Over a period, competition took advantage and took away orders which should have come to the company. By created a small effective Sales Team and getting the leadership involved , we ended the year with an all time high Order Book by a significant value, while achieving a record high revenue .</li>    
                <li>A key aspect of the Business Transformation was Culture Change. By Goal Deployment, Governance, creating a healthy competition between plants, and constant mentoring of influencers, we started seeing a significant change in the work culture. People started enjoying their successes. They became responsible, accountable and felt recognized for their efforts.</li> 
            </ol>
        
        </p>
        
        <p align = "justify">
            The company achieved almost 22% Revenue Growth, similar growth in profits and a 70% increase in year end Order Book. Our credit Ratings went up two notches, Banks came back with more attractive interest rates. Customers recognized that good things were happening at MXXXX !
